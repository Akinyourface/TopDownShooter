This is my first official project that i've been working on for several months now. Its a first project, and most of it was done with much sweat
and much toil and frustration. I'm proud to present a working demo for anybody interested. Just download and navigate to the 'scripts' directory and run 
the following command. "python Main.py". Also it should be noted one should have python 3 and the latest version of pygame in order for the game to work 
correctly. I made plans for a javascript port, but it's underway untill i can solve the problem of collision detection.
